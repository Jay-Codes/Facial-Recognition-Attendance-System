Fundamentals of software Project
# Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop an **automated attendance system** using **facial recognition** to eliminate attendance fraud and improve efficiency in classrooms. The system allows lecturers to start an attendance session, and a camera at the classroom entrance verifies students' identities using facial biometric data.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems are prone to:
- **Fraud** – Students can sign for absent classmates.
- **Time Consumption** – Manually taking attendance wastes valuable class time.
- **Inefficiency** – Paper-based or manual digital systems lack automation and real-time tracking.

## 💡 Solution
A **Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System** that:
✅ Uses biometric facial data to mark attendance automatically.  
✅ Provides a **lecturer dashboard** for session management and reporting.  
✅ **Eliminates fraud** by ensuring only present students are marked.  
✅ Generates attendance reports and integrates with school systems.

## 🏗️ Development Methodology: Waterfall Model  
We follow the **Waterfall Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** to ensure a structured approach.

1️⃣ **Requirement Analysis** – Define system needs, user roles, and technical requirements.  
2️⃣ **System Design** – Plan architecture, database schema, UI wireframes.  
3️⃣ **Implementation** – Develop frontend, backend, AI model, and integrate components.  
4️⃣ **Testing** – Perform unit, integration, and security testing.  
5️⃣ **Deployment & Maintenance** – Deploy on a server, monitor performance, and update AI models periodically.

## 🏛️ System Architecture  
The system consists of the following components:

- **Frontend** (React.js) – Lecturer Dashboard & Student Portal.  
- **Backend** (Node.js + Express) – Handles authentication, attendance sessions, and reporting.  
- **Database** (MongoDB) – Stores student data, attendance records, and lecturer details.  
- **Facial Recognition Module** (OpenCV & TensorFlow/Keras) – Detects and verifies student identities.  
- **Authentication** (OAuth + JWT) – Secure user login and session management.
